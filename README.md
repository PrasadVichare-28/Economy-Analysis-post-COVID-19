# Economy Analysis Post COVID-19

## Overview

This project analyzes the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on various sectors and countries. By examining key economic indicators before, during, and after the pandemic, the analysis aims to uncover trends, challenges, and recovery patterns that have emerged in the global economy.

## Objectives

- **Assess Economic Impact**: Evaluate how different economies have been affected by the pandemic.
- **Identify Recovery Patterns**: Analyze the recovery trajectories of various sectors.
- **Policy Analysis**: Examine the effectiveness of economic policies implemented in response to the crisis.

## Data Sources

The analysis utilizes data from reputable sources, including:

- **Kaggle**: [Economic Data: Life After COVID](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/keneticenergy/economic-data-life-after-covid)



## Methodology
1. **Data Cleaning**: Processed the data to handle missing values and ensure consistency.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualized trends and patterns to understand the impact of COVID-19.
3. **Comparative Analysis**: Compared economic indicators across different countries and sectors.


## Findings

- **Global GDP Impact**: The pandemic led to a significant contraction in global GDP in 2020, with varying recovery rates observed in subsequent years.
- **Sectoral Disparities**: Sectors such as tourism and hospitality experienced prolonged recovery periods, while technology and e-commerce sectors showed resilience and growth.
- **Policy Effectiveness**: Countries that implemented timely fiscal stimulus and effective public health measures tended to recover more rapidly.

## Visualizations

The project includes various visualizations to illustrate the economic impact and recovery patterns, such as:

- **GDP Growth Rates**: Line charts depicting GDP changes over time.
- **Unemployment Trends**: Bar graphs showing unemployment rate fluctuations.
- **Sectoral Analysis**: Heatmaps highlighting sector-specific impacts.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Languages**: Python
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Data Sources**: APIs and datasets from World Bank, IMF, and other statistical offices.
